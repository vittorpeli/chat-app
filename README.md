# Chat App Using React and Express

## Goal of the project
The goal of the project was to work with web sockets both with Node JS and React.

## How I Worked in this project
Tech I used:
- Client-side using React and Tailwind. I followed the basis of [CUBE CSS from Andy Bel with Tailwindl](https://github.com/Andy-set-studio/CUBE-with-tailwind) for styling.
- At Server-side used Express, Socket.io for real-time messaging, and Prisma with SQLite for the database.

For my work environment:
- Build the design on Figma. [Here](https://www.figma.com/file/rfCrAY6Quz4MVIc6ll5bSJ/Reddit-Style-Chat-Room?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=PywWkmGJRNAu5hMb-1)
- Worked with tasks in a Notion's Kanban board.
